# TODO
features:
- save scores
- multi player
- enter how many darts it took
- stats
- select nums to choose?
- undo option
- regenerate
- select just trips, singles etc with sliders
- only show past few and give option to show/hide all
- show order they were in, maybe single list of red and green vs seperate 
- use localstorage with option to clear it as mvp
- have continuous vs per round mode, i.e. they keep going and can use as many darts as they like instead of only 3, maybe make use of num darts and just let them enter however many but have default for 1-3
